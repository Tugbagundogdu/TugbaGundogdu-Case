About the project ;
- If you choose Departure Airport: Mumbai , Arrival Airport: New Delhi options while filling out the ticket form, you will see more tickets. This is just a recommendation. You can choose the option you want.
- ABOUT US , BOOKING TERMS ,FLIGHT and GET IN TOUCH pages are not intentionally created. Clicking on these will redirect you to the Not Found page. Thus, you will have examined the Not Found Page.
- When you click the Find Flight button, you will be directed to the flight ticket search section.
- You can re-filter the tickets according to their prices.
- When you click on the Buy Ticket button, it will direct you to the Product Detail Page.
